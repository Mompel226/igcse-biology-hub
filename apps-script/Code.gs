/**
 * Biology Labs — one spreadsheet for every lab
 * ============================================
 * Copyright (c) 2025-2026 Daniel Mompel Riera. All rights reserved.
 *
 * What this does
 *   • Collects hand-ins from every Biology Lab into one Sheet, a tab per lab.
 *   • Imports your Google Classroom rosters, so the marks sit next to real names
 *     and classes. Re-run it whenever someone joins: it adds, never duplicates.
 *   • Keeps only your own students: a hand-in is recorded when the Google account that
 *     signed in is on your roster, and ignored when it is not. The labs are public, so
 *     anyone may use them — their work simply does not land here.
 *   • Formats every tab so it is readable: nothing truncated, nothing too narrow,
 *     frozen headers, filters, banding. Re-apply it any time from the menu.
 *
 * SET UP  (five minutes, once, for every lab)
 *   1. Make one new Google Sheet. The name does not matter.
 *   2. From that Sheet: Extensions ▸ Apps Script. Delete what is there, paste this file in.
 *      You do NOT need to paste any id: the script is inside the Sheet, so it works out
 *      which one it is the first time you run it, and remembers.
 *      Then + (next to Files) ▸ HTML ▸ name it exactly  ClassroomImport
 *      and paste apps-script/ClassroomImport.html into it. Save.
 *   4. Services (+) ▸ Classroom ▸ Add.        (needed for the roster import)
 *   5. Run ▸ setup. Authorise when asked. It builds and styles every tab.
 *   6. Deploy ▸ New deployment ▸ Web app
 *        Execute as:      Me
 *        Who has access:  Anyone
 *      Deploy, copy the /exec URL, and paste it into each lab's js/config.js
 *      as submitUrl. One URL, all labs.
 *
 * AFTER ANY EDIT to this file: Deploy ▸ Manage deployments ▸ pencil ▸
 * Version: New version ▸ Deploy. Editing alone changes nothing.

/* ---- Signing in ----------------------------------------------------------
   The labs are public web pages: anyone in the world can open one, work through it and
   press Hand in. That is the point — but their work must not land in your spreadsheet.
   So a hand-in is kept only when the Google account that signed in is on your Students
   tab. Everyone else gets their completion code on screen and nothing is written down.

   A Client ID is a name-tag for your app, issued by Google. It is not a secret — it sits
   in plain sight in the page source. The lab page uses it to ask Google for a sign-in; this
   script uses it to check the token it gets back was made for YOUR app and not somebody
   else's. Same string in both places, or nothing is recorded.

   To get one (about five minutes, free):
     console.cloud.google.com ▸ pick or make a project
     ▸ Google Auth Platform ▸ Branding — fill this in FIRST, Google will not issue an id
       without it. User type External, then Audience ▸ Publish app. Left on "Testing",
       your students are told the app is blocked.
     ▸ Credentials ▸ Create credentials ▸ OAuth client ID ▸ Web application
       Authorised JavaScript origins:  https://mompel226.github.io
       (no path, no trailing slash. Leave redirect URIs empty.)
     Create, then copy the Client ID (it ends .apps.googleusercontent.com) into BOTH
     places: here, and googleClientId in every lab's js/config.js.
     The full version of this is in the README, under "Sign-in: what the Client ID is".

   Leave it empty and nothing is recorded at all — the labs still work, and everyone gets
   a completion code to hand in by other means.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
var CLIENT_ID = '';

/* Pasting a fresh copy of this file used to wipe the Client ID typed in above, and every
   hand-in then came back "not recorded: sign-in is not set up" — silently, until a mark went
   missing. So it is remembered the same way SHEET_ID is: fill the line above once, and from
   then on an empty line means "use the one you remembered", not "forget it". */
